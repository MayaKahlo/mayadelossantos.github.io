Hello! My name is Maya De Los Santos, and I am passionate about creating A.I. tools to empower marginalized communities. I care deeply about
the social impact of advancing technology and hope to continue my interests in data privacy and A.I. fairness throughout my academic and
professional career.

Currently, I am pursuing a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Northeastern University's Honors Program.
I am completing my second co-op assignment as a researcher in the Northeastern Civic A.I. Lab under the mentorship of [Dr. Saiph Savage](http://www.saiph.org/).
