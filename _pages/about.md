Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Maya De Los Santos is a first-generation Afro-Latina pursuing an Electrical and Computer Engineering degree in Northeastern University's Honors Program
and is a research assistant in the Civic AI lab led by [Dr. Saiph Savage](http://www.saiph.org/). In her current work, Maya is dedicated to designing and researching human-centered
AI systems that ensure fair work opportunities for Latina gig workers.

Maya is also a Google Generation Scholarship Recipient, a Grace Hopper Celebration Scholar, and was selected for an NSF grant to participate in Carnegie Mellon University's REUSE research program. Here, she published a first-author paper on TikTok users'
awareness of the platform's privacy policy, which was presented at the 20th International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia. Maya also holds several
leadership positions: she was the President of the Northeastern Chapter of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and is an active member of the Black Engineering
Student Society. In addition to her research in academia, Maya has also worked as a Software Engineer in Philips' healthcare department, where she utilized GitHub workflows,
CI/CD practices, and DevOps principles to streamline the transition to a modernized microservice-based application.

Maya is leveraging her engineering background to create human-centered AI technologies in collaboration with stakeholders in the US, Latin America, and the Caribbean. This has broadened her perspective on designing inclusive
intelligent technologies for underserved populations who have often been forgotten.

Maya cares deeply about advancing technology's social impact and hopes to continue her interests in data privacy and AI fairness in her future endeavors.
