Hello! My name is Maya De Los Santos, and I am passionate about creating A.I. tools to empower marginalized communities. I care deeply about
the social impact of advancing technology and hope to continue my interests in data privacy and A.I. fairness throughout my academic and
professional career.

Currently, I am pursuing a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Northeastern University's Honors Program.
I am completing my second co-op assignment as a researcher in Northeastern's Civic A.I. Lab under the mentorship of [Dr. Saiph Savage](http://www.saiph.org/).


You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
